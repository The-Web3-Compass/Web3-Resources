# 📬 Submission Guide – Web3 Resource Vault

So you’ve got something cool to share? Amazing! 🙌  
Here’s how you can contribute to the **Web3 Resource Vault** and keep it clean, helpful, and super easy for others to navigate.

## 🗂 Folder Structure

We’re organizing this repo like a digital library – by topic, then sub-topic. Here’s the vibe:

```
📁 languages/
   └─ 📁 solidity/
      ├─ docs.md
      ├─ videos.md
      ├─ blogs.md
      └─ tweets.md

📁 frameworks/
   └─ 📁 foundry/
      ├─ docs.md
      ├─ videos.md
      ├─ blogs.md
      └─ tweets.md

📁 protocols/
   └─ 📁 uniswap/
      ├─ docs.md
      ├─ videos.md
      ├─ blogs.md
      └─ tweets.md
```

If your topic doesn’t exist yet (say, `wallets/rainbow` or `infra/alchemy`), feel free to create a new folder — just keep the same structure! 

You can also add **new content types** if it makes sense for the topic — like `researchpapers.md`, `newsletters.md`, or even `podcasts.md`. Just keep things neat and consistent!
